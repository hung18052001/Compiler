Lexical analysis is the very first phase in the compiler designing
Lexemes and Tokens are the sequence of characters that are included in the source program according to the matching pattern of a token
Lexical analyzer is implemented to scan the entire source code of the program
Lexical analyzer helps to identify token into the symbol table
A character sequence which is not possible to scan into any valid token is a lexical error
Removes one character from the remaining input is useful Error recovery method
Lexical Analyser scan the input program while parser perform syntax analysis
It eases the process of lexical analysis and the syntax analysis by eliminating unwanted tokens
